# T192: Collaboration Space Architecture (Dopamine Design Canvas)

Welcome to **T192**, a research and development project exploring modern solutions for collaboration architecture. This repository embodies the **Dopamine Design Canvas**, a framework for designing dynamic, stimulating collaboration spaces—both digital and physical.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To model and experiment with new ways of structuring collaborative environments, applying principles from neuroscience (dopamine mechanics), architecture, and systems thinking.
- **Inspiration**: The Dopamine Design Canvas aims to make collaboration feel rewarding, efficient, and sustainable by aligning space design with motivational cues.

## Core Concepts

- **Collaboration Space**: A flexible, modular system supporting multiple interaction modalities (synchronous, asynchronous, remote, in-person).
- **Dopamine Design Canvas**: A blueprint/principle set for architecting environments that boost creative engagement and productivity.

## Core Framework: The Dopamine Design Canvas
The project identifies 10 specific triggers used to design collaborative environments:
*   **Shared Goals:** Celebrating micro-wins.
*   **Social Belonging:** Mutual recognition and kudos.
*   **Curiosity:** Exploration via digital "sandboxes."
*   **Self-Efficacy:** Visible individual impact (badges).
*   **Reflection:** Documenting progress and growth.
*   **Immediacy:** Real-time feedback loops.
*   **Gamification:** Framing work as "quests" with progress bars.
*   **Synchronization:** Collective flow through real-time co-creation.
*   **Identity:** Connecting work to a larger mission.
*   **Metacognition:** Reviewing "highlight reels" of team wins.

## Digital Workspace Architecture (v2.0)
The repository defines a structured 5-channel layout for digital environments:

1.  **Channel 01: Mission Control** (Identity/Serotonin) – Manifestos and impact metrics.
2.  **Channel 02: The Lab** (Novelty/Dopamine) – Prototyping and experiments.
3.  **Channel 03: Quest Board** (Anticipation/Dopamine) – Gamified sprint goals.
4.  **Channel 04: Watercooler Wins** (Belonging/Oxytocin) – Social recognition and kudos.
5.  **Channel 05: The Archives** (Pride/Serotonin) – Knowledge base and retrospectives.

## System Components

### Rituals
*   **Daily Quest Log:** A standup focused on "slaying monsters" (tasks) and identifying "support mages" (collaborators).
*   **Spark Session:** 25-minute silent co-working blocks followed by rapid-fire demos.
*   **Level Up Retro:** Weekly sessions for "Loot Drops" (wins) and "Experience Points" (learning).

### Visual Design (Neuro-coded)
*   **Dopamine Gold (#FFD700):** Progress bars and alerts.
*   **Oxytocin Warmth (#FF6B6B):** Mentions and social reactions.
*   **Serotonin Calm (#4ECDC4):** Completed tasks and archives.
*   **Flow Focus (#1A1A2E):** Deep work backgrounds.

### Automation: DopaBot
A conceptual bot logic designed to:
*   Post "First Blood" GIFs for the first task completed daily.
*   Pair team members for "Random Coffee" chats.
*   Activate "Flow Guard" to auto-reply to DMs during deep work.
*   Track contribution streaks with "On Fire" emojis.

## Tool Stack Configuration
*   **Async Comms:** Slack/Discord (Custom emojis, "Wins" channels).
*   **Project Management:** Trello (Confetti effects, cards as "Quests").
*   **Co-Creation:** Miro (Visible timers, voting plugins).

## Repository Files
*   `dopamine_design_canvas.md`: The underlying psychological framework and triggers.
*   `collaboration_space_architecture.md`: The technical blueprint for channel structure, UI, and rituals.
