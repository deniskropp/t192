# T192: Collaboration Space Architecture (Dopamine Design Canvas)

Welcome to **T192**, a research and development project exploring modern solutions for collaboration architecture. This repository embodies the **Dopamine Design Canvas**, a framework for designing dynamic, stimulating collaboration spaces—both digital and physical.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To model and experiment with new ways of structuring collaborative environments, applying principles from neuroscience (dopamine mechanics), architecture, and systems thinking.
- **Inspiration**: The Dopamine Design Canvas aims to make collaboration feel rewarding, efficient, and sustainable by aligning space design with motivational cues.

## Core Concepts

- **Collaboration Space**: A flexible, modular system supporting multiple interaction modalities (synchronous, asynchronous, remote, in-person).
- **Dopamine Design Canvas**: A blueprint/principle set for architecting environments that boost creative engagement and productivity.

## Features

- Architectural models & diagrams (coming soon)
- Foundational project files and documentation
- Experimentation with code structures for collaborative tools

## Repository Structure

- `/docs` — Documentation and conceptual files (design canvas, principles)
- `/models` — Architectural models and system representations
- `/src` — Code related to collaboration tools (structure may vary)
- [Additional folders or files as this project evolves]

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
